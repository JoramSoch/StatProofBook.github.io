**Theorem:**

Notation: let $z_x = \Phi^{-1}(1 - x)$, where $\Phi$ is the CDF of a $N(0, 1)$ distribution. Equivalently, with $Z \sim N(0, 1)$,
$$
\label{eq:zx-definition}
z_x = \Phi^{-1}(1 - x) \Leftrightarrow \Phi(z_x) = 1 - x \Leftrightarrow \mathbb{P}(Z \leq z_x) = 1 - x \Leftrightarrow \mathbb{P}(z_x \leq Z) = x.
$$

Let there be $n$ i.i.d. observations $Y_1, \dots, Y_n \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ (with both $\mu, \sigma^2$ unknown).

*One-sided*

We perform a one-sided one-sample $t$-test of the [null hypothesis](/D/h0) $H_0: \mu \leq \mu_0$ vs $H_1: \mu > \mu_0$. The test has [significance level](/D/alpha) $\alpha$. If $H_1$ is true and $\mu = \mu_0 + \delta$, then the [power](/D/power) of the test is
$$
\label{eq:power-one-sided}
\Phi\left(\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} - z_\alpha\right).
$$
If we keep $\alpha, n, \sigma^2$ the same as before, and require that the power is at least $1 - \beta$, then the [minimum detectable effect](/D/mde) is
$$
\label{eq:mde-one-sided}
\frac{(z_\alpha + z_\beta)\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.
$$
If we keep $\alpha, \sigma^2, \delta, \beta$ the same as before then the [minimum required sample size](/D/mrss) is
$$
\label{eq:mrss-one-sided}
\frac{\sigma^2(z_\alpha + z_\beta)^2}{\delta^2}.
$$

*Two-sided*

We perform a two-sided one-sample $t$-test of hypothesis $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$. The test has size $\alpha$. If $H_1$ is true and $\mu = \mu_0 + \delta$ (WLOG assuming $\delta > 0$), then the [power](/D/power) of the test is
$$
\label{eq:power-two-sided}
\Phi\left(\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} - z_{\alpha/2}\right) + \Phi\left(-z_{\alpha/2} - \frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}\right) \approx \Phi\left(\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} - z_{\alpha/2}\right).
$$
If we keep $\alpha, n, \sigma^2$ the same as before, and require that the power is at least $1 - \beta$, then the [minimum detectable effect](/D/mde) is
$$
\label{eq:mde-two-sided}
\frac{(z_{\alpha/2} + z_\beta) \sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.
$$
If we keep $\alpha, \sigma^2, \delta, \beta$ the same as before then the [minimum required sample size](/D/mde) is
$$
\label{eq:sample-size-two-sided}
\frac{\sigma^2(z_{\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2}{\delta^2}.
$$

**Proof:**

The $t$-statistic is
$$
\label{eq:t-statistic}
T = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}.
$$
which [has a $t(n-1)$ distribution](/P/ug-ttest1). Unless $n$ is very small, the $t(n-1)$ distribution is very close to a $N(0, 1)$ distribution, and I will assume that this is a good approximation in this proof.

*One-sided*

The test has [size](/D/size) $\alpha$, we reject the null if
$$
\label{eq:one-sided-rejection}
T > z_\alpha.
$$

So the [power](/D/power) of the test is
$$
\label{eq:one-sided-power-prob}
\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} > z_\alpha\right).
$$

If the true mean is $\mu = \mu_0 + \delta$, where $\delta > 0$, then the power is
$$
\label{eq:one-sided-power-shift}
\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0 - \delta}{s/\sqrt{n}} + \frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{s} > z_\alpha\right).
$$

Now that we're subtracting the true mean, the first term in the sum has a $t$ distribution, which we approximate with a $N(0, 1)$ distribution, $Z$. We also approximate $s$ with $\sigma$, since it should be a good approximation, and the error here doesn't make much difference to the calculation. The power is therefore approximately
$$
\label{eq:one-sided-power-final}
\mathbb{P}\left(Z > z_\alpha - \frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}\right) = \mathbb{P}\left(Z < \frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} - z_\alpha\right) = \Phi\left(\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} - z_\alpha\right).
$$

To calculate the [minimum detectable effect](/D/mde), we want the smallest $\delta$ such that the power is at least $1-\beta$. If the power is at least $1-\beta$ then
$$
\label{eq:one-sided-power-threshold}
1 - \beta \leq \Phi\left(\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} - z_\alpha\right),
$$
Using $z_\beta = \Phi^{-1}(1 - \beta)$ and rearranging, we get
$$
\label{eq:one-sided-delta-ineq}
z_\beta + z_\alpha \leq \frac{\delta \sqrt{n}}{\sigma}.
$$
Therefore
$$
\label{eq:one-sided-delta}
\frac{(z_\beta + z_\alpha)\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \delta,
$$
and taking the minimum value for $\delta$ gives the minimum detectable effect.

To calculate the [minimum required sample size](/D/mrss), we want the smallest $n$ such that the power is at least $1 - \beta$. Rearranging \eqref{eq:one-sided-power-threshold}, we have
$$
\label{eq:one-sided-n}
\frac{\sigma^2(z_\alpha + z_\beta)^2}{\delta^2} \leq n.
$$

*Two-sided*

The test has [size](/D/size) $\alpha$, we reject the null if
$$
\label{eq:two-sided-rejection}
|T| > z_{\alpha/2}.
$$

So the [power](/D/power) of the test is
$$
\label{eq:two-sided-power-prob}
\mathbb{P}\left(\left(\frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} > z_{\alpha/2}\right) \wedge \left(\frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} < -z_{\alpha/2}\right)\right).
$$

If the true mean is $\mu = \mu_0 + \delta$, where WLOG $\delta > 0$, then the power is
$$
\label{eq:two-sided-power-shift}
\mathbb{P}\left(\left(\frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0 - \delta}{s/\sqrt{n}} + \frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} > z_{\alpha/2}\right) \wedge \left(\frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0 - \delta}{s/\sqrt{n}} + \frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} < -z_{\alpha/2}\right)\right).
$$

As before, we use a $N(0, 1)$ distribution, denoted $Z$. And we approximate $s$ with $\sigma$. The power is therefore approximately
$$
\label{eq:two-sided-power-almost-final}
\Phi\left(\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} - z_{\alpha/2}\right) + \Phi\left(-z_{\alpha/2} - \frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}\right).
$$

If we have a large enough $\delta$ then the second term, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis but with a sign error on $\delta$, will be small. For the later calculations, we will set it to $0$ and use the approximation
$$
\label{eq:two-sided-power-final}
\Phi\left(\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} - z_{\alpha/2}\right)
$$
for the power.

To calculate the [minimum detectable effect](/D/mde), we want the smallest $\delta$ such that the power is at least $1-\beta$. If the power is at least $1-\beta$ then
$$
\label{eq:two-sided-power-threshold}
1 - \beta \leq \Phi\left(\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} - z_{\alpha/2}\right),
$$
Using $z_\beta = \Phi^{-1}(1 - \beta)$ and rearranging, we get
$$
\label{eq:two-sided-delta-ineq}
z_\beta + z_{\alpha/2} \leq \frac{\delta \sqrt{n}}{\sigma}.
$$
Therefore
$$
\label{eq:two-sided-delta}
\frac{(z_\beta + z_{\alpha/2})\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \delta,
$$
and taking the minimum value for $\delta$ gives the minimum detectable effect.

To calculate the [minimum required sample size](/D/mrss), we want the smallest $n$ such that the power is at least $1 - \beta$. Rearranging \eqref{eq:two-sided-power-threshold}, we have
$$
\label{eq:two-sided-n}
\frac{\sigma^2(z_{\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2}{\delta^2} \leq n.
$$
